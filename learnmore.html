                <p>With a group of other consultants, we worked directly with real company clients in assisting with
                    business problem solving, company strategic design, and risk management. We would meet with clients
                    to discuss current regulations and problems with client's current company structure. My team and I
                    will then analyze information given and provide recommendations and its given timeline for
                    completion. With the usages of Microsoft Suite, we delivered and presented a detailed deliverable of
                    a mapped out business strategy. The end result of this project was a successful output and
                    satisfaction from client.</p>
